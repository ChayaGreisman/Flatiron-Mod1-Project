# Description
StoreManager is an app for managing inventory. It can be used by anyone who has a username stored in the database, whether owner, manager, or other employees. We created this app with some existing users, products, and categories in the database. Once a user has successfully signed in, they have access to various inventory tasks including adding, updating, accessing, and deleting inventory data, as well as adding or deleting other users.
